# Introduction to Python and Computational Linguistics Project

## Description
This repository contains the group project for the 'Introduction to Python' and 'Computational Linguistics' courses as part of our Master's degree. The project investigates whether vector embeddings created by BERT exhibit symmetry when representing opposite positional statements.

## Contents
- `BERT_probing_ps.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all the Python code used for the project.
- `data/`: Folder containing datasets used in the analysis.
- `BERT_positional_statements_python.pdf`: Project report for the 'Introduction to Python' course.
- `CompLing_Course_Report.pdf`: Project report for the 'Computational Linguistics' course.

## Installation
To run the Jupyter Notebook:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or open it in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.

## Usage
Open the `` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to view the code and analysis.
